The following project is an android application completed for CMPT 362.
This app is a fitness tracker that allows users to record fitness activity either manually, with GPS, or automatically.
The GPS entry uses the MAPS SDK to record location data and calculate values like distance travelled, average speed, and elavation gain.
The automatic entry uses a Weka model to predict if users are standing, walking or running.
All data is stored using Room.

To use the app download the "Fitness Tracker.apk" file and run it on an android device or emulator.
