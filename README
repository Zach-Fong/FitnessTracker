The following project is an android application completed for CMPT 362.
This app is a fitness tracker that allows users to record fitness activity.
To use the app download the "Fitness Tracker.apk" file and run it on an android device or emulator.

To record fitness, select a type: manual, GPS, or automatic.
The manual entry allows users to manually enter fitness data.
The GPS entry uses the MAPS SDK to record location data and calculate values like distance traveled, average speed, and elavation gain.
The automatic entry uses a Weka model to predict if users are standing, walking or running.
Users can then view their saved workouts in the history tab and can delete them. All data is stored using Room.
Users can also change preferences like units (kilometers or miles), create a user profile, and more under the settings tab.
